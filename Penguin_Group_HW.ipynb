Soft ad - ad bonus appears every 2 minutes that will pass 1 hour of work. Hard ad - for permanent bonuses, specific objectives prompt you to watch an ad every 3rd objective. Your progression goes from exponential to pathetically linear without ads. Then it's a $30 A MONTH subscription to stop all ads. Triple A games arent worth $360 a year. This isnt worth $20 one time pay Prediction=> 3\n",

Now, all I care about is how to make more coins, which by the way, has become increasingly hard after the Hot Air Balloon. The upgrade cost of habitats has become more than they make, as I've noticed. The offline rewards are not giving out enough coins and its very, very hard to get enough heart tokens as well.

Unlike most games, the ads in PI are to the player's benefit and there's no requirement to watch them. The devs have introduced awesome events and there are in-app purchases, but there's no pushiness to take part in them. This game is very relaxed and slow-paced; perfect for calming down or destressing. All in all, a 5 star game. Prediction=> 5\n",
            "I loved this game at first but now it's getting a little annoying with certain things not working, mainly the ads no longer working. The optional ads always loaded at first, until I started getting closer to finishing the 1st anniversary event. You need to either buy the Ad Skip coupons or watch the ads. All of a sudden the ads will not load at all, so I felt forced to buy the skip ad tickets so I could keep playing. After running out of Ad skips the ads loaded a few times and quit again.

            "I would have loved it, but it just had too many ads. If you want all optimal rewards you will be constantly watching 30 second ads with 15 seconds of gameplay between them. If you want to progress you will be watching more ads then play the actual game. Otherwise it would be a very charming game that could be a relaxing base builder, but currently it is more of an ad watching simulator. Prediction=> 1\n",

            "I really like this game, I think the rewards for watching ads are fair and give a good chance to build up premium currency (gems in this case) without having to purchase them. Also, the purpose of the game which is essentially collecting penguins is enjoyable, and it's fun to watch the island grow with time. The only aspect that mildly annoys me is the quest in which the fishing spot has to be upgraded to a certain level, it seems to be always the fishing spot and that takes some time to do.

It's cute, sure, but if it weren't for how my brain gets hooked on seeing numbers go up (rewards! animations! more money/hearts/jewels!) I can't imagine I would care. At it's heart, the game is actually a dull lesson about compound interest that I pay with my time and eyeballs watching ads for other ad-ridden games. It's compelling that way, but certainly not because it gives me much in return. I don't feel rewarded or satisfied as much as a compulsion to keep going at it.

I hate to say this, but it's a shame that you made all those beautiful furniture items, but locked them behind a low limit.

            "Another quick suggestion, I've only got one habitat to buy now but all the quests keep focusing on upgrading the fishing habitat now which makes it really hard to get research points. Maybe mix it up with more collecting penguin hearts, opening chests, whale summonings or time tokens? That way there's more reason to stay and keep playing than just waiting for my money to pile up to upgrade the fishing spot again Prediction=> 4\n",
